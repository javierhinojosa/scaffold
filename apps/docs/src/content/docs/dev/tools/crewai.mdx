import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Overview

CrewAI is integrated into our monorepo to orchestrate role-playing AI agents that work together to accomplish complex tasks. Our implementation includes custom agents, tasks, and tools that help automate various development processes.

## Architecture

The CrewAI implementation is located in the `apps/crewai/development` directory and follows a structured approach:

```
apps/crewai/development/
├── src/
│   └── development/
│       ├── config/
│       │   ├── agents.yaml    # Agent definitions
│       │   └── tasks.yaml     # Task definitions
│       ├── crew.py           # Main crew implementation
│       └── main.py          # Entry point
├── docs/                    # Generated documentation
└── knowledge/              # Knowledge base for agents
```

## Key Components

### 1. Agents

Agents are defined in `agents.yaml` and are instantiated with specific roles, goals, and tools. Our implementation includes:

- Documentation maintainers
- Validation agents
- Task-specific specialists

### 2. Tasks

Tasks are configured in `tasks.yaml` and represent the work units that agents need to complete. Each task includes:

- Description
- Expected output
- Assigned agent
- Output file (if applicable)

### 3. Tracing and Monitoring

Our CrewAI implementation is integrated with Langfuse for comprehensive tracing and monitoring:

```python
# Initialize Langfuse
langfuse = Langfuse(
    public_key="[configured-key]",
    secret_key="[configured-key]",
    host="https://us.cloud.langfuse.com"
)
```

Each agent action and task execution is traced for monitoring and debugging purposes.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Virtual environment management

### Setup

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="macOS/Linux">```bash python -m venv .venv source .venv/bin/activate ```</TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Windows">```bash python -m venv .venv .venv\Scripts\activate ```</TabItem>
</Tabs>

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r apps/crewai/development/requirements.txt
```

3. Configure environment variables:

```bash
cp apps/crewai/development/.env.example apps/crewai/development/.env
```

### Running CrewAI

To execute the CrewAI system:

1. Navigate to the development directory:

```bash
cd apps/crewai/development
```

2. Run the main script:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

## Custom Tools

Our CrewAI implementation includes several custom tools:

1. **Directory Operations**

   - List directory contents
   - Generate file trees
   - Read file contents

2. **Documentation Tools**
   - Sitemap generation
   - Documentation validation
   - Knowledge base integration

## Best Practices

1. **Configuration Management**

   - Keep agent and task configurations in YAML files
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data
   - Version control configuration changes

2. **Error Handling**

   - Implement comprehensive error tracking
   - Use Langfuse traces for debugging
   - Handle edge cases gracefully

3. **Testing**
   - Test agent behaviors independently
   - Validate task outputs
   - Monitor performance metrics

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Environment Setup**

   - Ensure Python version compatibility
   - Verify all dependencies are installed
   - Check environment variables

2. **Execution Issues**

   - Review Langfuse traces for errors
   - Check agent configurations
   - Validate task definitions

3. **Performance**
   - Monitor execution times
   - Optimize tool usage
   - Review resource consumption
