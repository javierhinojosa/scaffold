description: Learn how to set up and use Temporal for workflow orchestration in the SFH project
---

## Overview

[Temporal](https://temporal.io/) is a workflow orchestration platform that helps you build reliable distributed applications. This guide will walk you through setting up Temporal locally and integrating it with our TypeScript codebase.

## Prerequisites

Before working with Temporal, ensure you have:
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed on your macOS system
- Node.js and pnpm (as per our [getting started guide](/dev/getting-started))

## Installation

1. Install the Temporal CLI using Homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew install temporal
   ```

2. Start the Temporal server:
   ```bash
   temporal server start-dev
   ```

   This command starts a local Temporal server with default configurations. The Web UI will be available at [http://localhost:8233](http://localhost:8233).

## TypeScript SDK Setup

We use the Temporal TypeScript SDK in our monorepo. The SDK is already configured in our project, but here's what you need to know:

1. The SDK dependencies are:
   ```json
   {
     "@temporalio/client": "^1.8.0",
     "@temporalio/worker": "^1.8.0",
     "@temporalio/workflow": "^1.8.0"
   }
   ```

2. Our Temporal client configuration is centralized and can be imported from our shared utilities.

## Local Development

When developing locally:

1. Always ensure the Temporal server is running:
   ```bash
   temporal server start-dev
   ```

2. Start your application's Temporal worker in a separate terminal:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev:worker
   ```

3. You can monitor your workflows through the Temporal Web UI at [http://localhost:8233](http://localhost:8233)

## Best Practices

- Keep workflow code deterministic
- Handle errors appropriately using Temporal's retry policies
- Use signals for external events that can affect workflow execution
- Implement proper logging and monitoring

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. If the Temporal server fails to start:
   - Check if the ports (7233 for gRPC, 8233 for Web UI) are available
   - Ensure no other Temporal instance is running

2. If workflow execution fails:
   - Check the Web UI for detailed error messages
   - Verify your workflow code is deterministic
   - Ensure your worker is running and connected to the server
