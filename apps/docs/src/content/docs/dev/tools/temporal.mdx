description: Learn how to set up and use Temporal for workflow orchestration in the SFH project

## Overview

[Temporal](https://temporal.io/) is a workflow orchestration platform that helps you build reliable distributed applications. In our project, we use Temporal through a Flask-based server located in `apps/temporal` that manages our workflows and provides REST endpoints for workflow management.

## Prerequisites

Before working with Temporal, ensure you have:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed on your macOS system
- Node.js and pnpm (as per our [getting started guide](/dev/getting-started))
- Python 3.x installed for our Flask-based Temporal server

## Installation

1. Install the Temporal CLI using Homebrew:

   ```bash
   brew install temporal
   ```

2. Set up the Python environment for our Flask-based Temporal server:

   ```bash
   cd apps/temporal
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Our Flask server uses the following key dependencies:

   ```
   flask==3.0.2
   temporalio==1.9.0
   python-dotenv==1.0.1
   gunicorn==21.2.0
   ```

## Architecture

Our Temporal integration consists of three main components:

1. **Temporal Server**: The core Temporal service that manages workflow state and orchestration
2. **Flask Server**: A REST API that provides endpoints for workflow management
3. **Temporal Worker**: A Python process that executes the actual workflow activities

### Flask Server (`app.py`)

The Flask server provides the following REST endpoints:

- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `GET /workflows` - List all workflows
- `GET /workflow/<workflow_id>` - Get workflow status
- `POST /workflow` - Start a new workflow

### Workflows (`workflows.py`)

We define our workflows and activities in `workflows.py`. Currently, we have a sample greeting workflow:

```python
@activity.defn
async def say_hello(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

@workflow.defn
class GreetingWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, name: str) -> str:
        return await workflow.execute_activity(
            say_hello,
            name,
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=5)
        )
```

### Worker (`worker.py`)

The worker process connects to the Temporal server and executes workflow activities. It runs separately from the Flask server and handles the actual workflow execution.

## Local Development

When developing locally, you need to run three components in separate terminals:

1. Start the Temporal server:

   ```bash
   temporal server start-dev
   ```

   This starts a local Temporal server with default configurations. The Web UI will be available at [http://localhost:8233](http://localhost:8233).

2. Start the Flask server:

   ```bash
   cd apps/temporal
   source venv/bin/activate
   python app.py
   ```

   The Flask server will run at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

3. Start the Temporal worker:
   ```bash
   cd apps/temporal
   source venv/bin/activate
   python worker.py
   ```

## Using the API

### Start a New Workflow

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/workflow \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "World"}'
```

### Check Workflow Status

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/workflow/your-workflow-id
```

### List All Workflows

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/workflows
```

## Best Practices

- Keep workflow code deterministic
- Handle errors appropriately using Temporal's retry policies
- Use signals for external events that can affect workflow execution
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Always activate the Python virtual environment when working with the Flask server
- Keep the `requirements.txt` up to date when adding new Python dependencies

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. If the Temporal server fails to start:

   - Check if the ports (7233 for gRPC, 8233 for Web UI) are available
   - Ensure no other Temporal instance is running

2. If workflow execution fails:

   - Check the Web UI for detailed error messages
   - Verify your workflow code is deterministic
   - Ensure your worker is running and connected to the server

3. If the Flask server fails to start:
   - Verify the virtual environment is activated
   - Check if all dependencies are installed correctly
   - Look for error messages in the Flask server logs
