# CrewAI Implementation

CrewAI is a powerful framework for orchestrating role-playing AI agents. In our implementation, we use CrewAI to create autonomous agents that can work together to accomplish complex tasks.

## Local Development Setup

To run the CrewAI implementation locally, you'll need to set up a Python virtual environment. This ensures that all dependencies are properly isolated and managed.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Setting up the Virtual Environment

1. First, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd your-project-directory
```

2. Create a new virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

On macOS/Linux:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows:

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

4. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Important Notes

- Always ensure your virtual environment (`.venv`) is activated when working with CrewAI
- The `.venv` directory is included in `.gitignore` to prevent committing environment-specific files
- If you add new dependencies, remember to update `requirements.txt`:
  ```bash
  pip freeze > requirements.txt
  ```

## Configuration

Make sure you have the necessary environment variables set up in your `.env` file:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
# Add any other required environment variables
```

## Running CrewAI

Once your virtual environment is set up and activated, you can run the CrewAI implementation using the provided scripts. Make sure to check the specific documentation for each agent and task implementation in your codebase.

## Best Practices

1. Always activate the virtual environment before running CrewAI-related code
2. Keep your dependencies up to date
3. Document any changes to the agent implementations
4. Test your changes thoroughly before committing

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated
2. Verify all required dependencies are installed
3. Check that your `.env` file contains all necessary environment variables
4. Make sure you're using a compatible Python version
