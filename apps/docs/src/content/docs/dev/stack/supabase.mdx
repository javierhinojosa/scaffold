description: How we use Supabase as our backend database and authentication provider
---

## Why Supabase?

[Supabase](https://supabase.com) serves as our primary backend database and authentication provider. We chose Supabase for several compelling reasons:

- **PostgreSQL-Based**: Built on top of PostgreSQL, providing a robust and reliable database foundation
- **Real-Time Capabilities**: Built-in real-time subscriptions for live data updates
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Comprehensive auth system with Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Type Safety**: Generated TypeScript types for database schema
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent developer tooling and dashboard
- **Edge Functions**: Serverless functions for custom backend logic

## Setup and Configuration

### Package Structure

We maintain Supabase-related code in our `@sfh/backend` package that centralizes all backend functionality:

```typescript
// packages/backend/src/supabase.ts
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
import type { Database } from './types';

export function createSupabaseClient(supabaseUrl: string, supabaseKey: string) {
  return createClient<Database>(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey);
}
```

### Usage in Applications

To use Supabase in any of our applications:

1. Import the client creator:

```typescript
import { createSupabaseClient } from '@sfh/backend';

export const supabase = createSupabaseClient(
  import.meta.env.PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,
  import.meta.env.PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
);
```

2. Use the typed client for database operations:

```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase.from('users').select(`
    id,
    email,
    profiles (
      avatar_url,
      bio
    )
  `);
```

## Environment Variables

Each application using Supabase requires these environment variables:

```bash
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="your-project-url"
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-anon-key"
```

For secure operations (like admin functions), we also use:

```bash
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY="your-service-key"
```

## Type Safety

We leverage Supabase's type generation to maintain type safety across our applications:

1. Database types are defined in `packages/backend/src/types.ts`
2. Types include full definitions for all tables, including:
   - `Row` types for reading data
   - `Insert` types for creating new records
   - `Update` types for modifying existing records
3. All database operations are fully typed through these generated types

## Schema Management

We maintain our database schema using Supabase migrations in `packages/backend/supabase/migrations/`. This approach provides several benefits:

- **Version Control**: Track all schema changes in Git
- **Documentation**: SQL serves as a clear, self-documenting specification
- **Reproducibility**: Easy to recreate database structure in new environments
- **Review Process**: Schema changes go through code review like any other change

### Schema Structure

Our initial schema in `20240211_initial_schema.sql` includes:

```sql
-- Core tables
create table public.users (
  id uuid primary key default uuid_generate_v4(),
  email text unique not null,
  full_name text,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  updated_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
);

create table public.profiles (
  id uuid primary key references public.users(id) on delete cascade,
  avatar_url text,
  bio text,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  updated_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
);
```

### Row Level Security (RLS)

We enforce access control at the database level using RLS policies. Each table has explicit policies defining who can perform what operations:

```sql
-- Enable RLS
alter table public.users enable row level security;
alter table public.profiles enable row level security;

-- Define policies
create policy "Users can view their own profile"
  on public.users
  for select
  using (auth.uid() = id);

create policy "Users can update their own profile"
  on public.users
  for update
  using (auth.uid() = id);

create policy "Profiles are viewable by owner"
  on public.profiles
  for select
  using (auth.uid() = id);

create policy "Profiles are updatable by owner"
  on public.profiles
  for update
  using (auth.uid() = id);
```

### Schema Updates

When making schema changes:

1. Generate a new migration file:

```bash
supabase migration new your_migration_name
```

2. Add your schema changes to the new migration file
3. Update TypeScript types in `types.ts` to match the schema changes
4. Test changes locally
5. Submit PR for review, including both migration and type changes
6. After merge, apply changes to staging/production environments

### Applying Schema Changes

#### Local Development

To apply schema changes to your local Supabase instance:

1. Start your local Supabase instance:

```bash
supabase start
```

2. Reset the database and apply migrations:

```bash
supabase db reset
```

This command will:

- Drop all existing tables
- Apply all migrations in sequence
- Seed any test data if configured

For incremental changes during development, you can also use the Supabase Studio UI at `http://localhost:54323` to:

- Execute SQL commands directly
- View and modify data
- Test RLS policies
- Debug real-time subscriptions

#### Remote Environments

For staging and production environments:

1. Connect to the remote project:

```bash
supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref
```

2. Push migrations:

```bash
supabase db push
```

#### Best Practices for Schema Deployment

- Always test migrations locally first
- Create separate migration files for each logical change
- Back up production data before applying major schema changes
- Schedule schema updates during low-traffic periods
- Monitor the application during and after schema updates
- Have a rollback plan for each schema change
- Update application code to handle both old and new schemas during deployment

### Best Practices for Schema Design

- Always include `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps on tables
- Use UUIDs for primary keys (`uuid-ossp` extension)
- Enforce referential integrity with foreign key constraints
- Enable RLS by default on all tables
- Write explicit RLS policies for each operation type
- Use timestamptz for all timestamp columns
- Add appropriate indices for frequently queried columns

## Best Practices

- Always use the shared `@sfh/backend` package instead of creating separate clients
- Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all tables
- Use TypeScript types for all database operations
- Keep sensitive operations in edge functions using service role
- Handle errors appropriately in all database operations
- Use optimistic updates with real-time subscriptions for better UX

## Common Patterns

### Authentication Flow

```typescript
// Sign in user
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
  email,
  password,
});

// Get authenticated user
const {
  data: { user },
} = await supabase.auth.getUser();

// Sign out
await supabase.auth.signOut();
```

### Real-time Subscriptions

```typescript
const channel = supabase
  .channel('table_changes')
  .on('postgres_changes', { event: '*', schema: 'public', table: 'messages' }, (payload) => {
    // Handle real-time updates
  })
  .subscribe();
```

### Authentication

For detailed information about our authentication implementation using Supabase Auth, Svelte, and Astro, please refer to our dedicated [Authentication](/dev/stack/authentication) documentation.

## Security Considerations

- Never expose the service key in client-side code
- Always implement RLS policies before exposing tables
- Use service role only in secure server contexts
- Regularly audit RLS policies and access patterns
- Keep Supabase project URL and keys in environment variables
