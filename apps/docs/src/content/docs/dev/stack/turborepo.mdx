description: How we use Turborepo to manage our monorepo build system and optimize our development workflow
---

## Overview

[Turborepo](https://turbo.build/) is our build system orchestration tool that helps us manage our monorepo efficiently. It provides:

- **Intelligent Build Caching**: Speeds up builds by caching task outputs
- **Task Pipeline Management**: Defines dependencies between tasks across packages
- **Parallel Execution**: Runs tasks in parallel when possible
- **Workspace Management**: Handles dependencies between packages effectively

## Configuration

### Root Configuration

Our root `turbo.json` defines the core pipeline and task configurations:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
  "ui": "tui",
  "tasks": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "inputs": ["$TURBO_DEFAULT$", ".env*"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**", "!dist/cache/**"]
    },
    "lint": {
      "dependsOn": ["^lint"]
    },
    "check-types": {
      "dependsOn": ["^check-types"]
    },
    "dev": {
      "cache": true,
      "persistent": true
    },
    "clean": {
      "cache": false,
      "outputs": []
    },
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "inputs": [
        "src/**/*.{astro,svelte,ts,tsx}",
        "tests/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
        "vitest.config.{js,ts}",
        "tsconfig.json"
      ],
      "outputs": ["coverage/**", "test-results/**"]
    }
  },
  "globalDependencies": ["tsconfig.json", ".env*"]
}
```

### Workspace Setup

Our workspaces are defined in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:

```yaml
packages:
  - 'apps/*'
  - 'packages/*'
```

## Task Pipeline

### Core Tasks

1. **Build**

   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

   - Builds all packages and applications
   - Respects dependencies between packages
   - Uses `$TURBO_DEFAULT$` and `.env*` files as inputs
   - Outputs to `dist/**` (excluding cache)

2. **Development**

   ```bash
   pnpm dev --filter <app-name>
   ```

   - Starts development server for specific application
   - Runs in persistent mode with caching enabled
   - Watches for changes in dependencies

3. **Testing**

   ```bash
   pnpm test
   ```

   - Runs tests across all packages
   - Depends on build task completion
   - Handles various test types (unit, integration, e2e)
   - Outputs to `coverage/**` and `test-results/**`

4. **Type Checking**

   ```bash
   pnpm check-types
   ```

   - Runs TypeScript type checking across packages
   - Ensures type safety across the monorepo

5. **Linting**

   ```bash
   pnpm lint
   ```

   - Runs linting across all packages
   - Respects dependencies between packages

6. **Cleaning**
   ```bash
   pnpm clean
   ```
   - Cleans build artifacts
   - No caching for clean operations
   - `pnpm clean:all` also removes node_modules

### Testing Configuration

Our setup includes specialized test tasks:

1. **Unit Tests**

   ```bash
   pnpm test:unit
   ```

   - Focuses on unit tests in `tests/unit`
   - Uses Vitest for test execution
   - Outputs coverage reports

2. **Integration Tests**

   ```bash
   pnpm test:integration
   ```

   - Runs integration tests from `tests/integration`
   - Depends on build completion
   - Generates coverage reports

3. **E2E Tests**

   ```bash
   pnpm test:e2e
   ```

   - Executes end-to-end tests using Playwright
   - Tests from `e2e` directory
   - Generates Playwright reports

4. **Watch Mode**

   ```bash
   pnpm test:watch
   ```

   - Runs tests in watch mode
   - No caching
   - Persistent execution

5. **CI Testing**
   ```bash
   pnpm test:ci
   ```
   - Comprehensive test suite for CI environments
   - Runs all test types
   - Includes additional CI-specific configurations
   - Outputs all test reports and coverage

## Best Practices

### Task Configuration

1. **Input/Output Management**

   - Define specific input patterns for accurate caching
   - Exclude cache directories from outputs
   - Include environment files in global dependencies

2. **Task Dependencies**
   - Use `dependsOn` to establish correct build order
   - Ensure type checking and linting run independently
   - Configure persistent tasks for development

### Workspace Organization

1. **Package Structure**

   - Organize code in `apps/*` and `packages/*`
   - Share common code through packages
   - Maintain clear dependency boundaries

2. **Dependencies**
   - Use PNPM as package manager
   - Support Node.js versions 18, 20, and 22+
   - Lock specific built dependencies (e.g., esbuild)
