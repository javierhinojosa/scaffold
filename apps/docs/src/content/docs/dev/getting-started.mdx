## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (version 8.15.4)
- Git

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sfh.git
   cd sfh
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Build all packages:
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Running Applications

To start any application in development mode:

```bash
pnpm dev --filter <app-name>
```

For example:
- Admin dashboard: `pnpm dev --filter admin`
- Documentation site: `pnpm dev --filter docs`

### Running Tests

We use Vitest for unit tests and Playwright for end-to-end tests.

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests for a specific app/package
pnpm test --filter <app-name>

# Run tests in UI mode
pnpm test:ui
```

### Code Quality

We maintain high code quality standards using various tools:

```bash
# Format code
pnpm format

# Lint code
pnpm lint
```

## Project Structure
