# Git & GitHub Practices

This guide outlines our standard practices for using Git and GitHub to manage our codebase effectively.

## Branch Structure

We follow a modified GitFlow workflow with the following branch structure:

- `main`: Production-ready code that has been thoroughly tested and is ready for deployment
- `develop`: Main development branch where features are integrated
- `feature/*`: Feature branches for new development work
- `bugfix/*`: Branches for bug fixes
- `hotfix/*`: Emergency fixes for production issues
- `release/*`: Release preparation branches

### Branch Naming Convention

- Feature branches: `feature/descriptive-feature-name`
- Bug fix branches: `bugfix/issue-description`
- Hotfix branches: `hotfix/critical-fix-description`
- Release branches: `release/vX.Y.Z`

## Workflow Guidelines

1. **Starting New Work**
   - Create branches from `develop` for new features
   - Use meaningful branch names that describe the work
   - One feature/task per branch

2. **Commits**
   - Write clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
   - Reference issue numbers when applicable

3. **Pull Requests**
   - Create detailed PR descriptions
   - Include testing steps and screenshots if relevant
   - Request reviews from appropriate team members
   - Ensure CI checks pass before merging

4. **Merging**
   - Squash and merge feature branches into `develop`
   - Use regular merge for `develop` into `main`
   - Delete branches after merging

## Git Ignore Rules

We maintain a comprehensive `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from version control. Key ignored items include:

### Development
- Dependencies (`node_modules/`, `venv/`, `.pnp`)
- Build outputs (`dist/`, `build/`, `.next/`, `.astro/`)
- Environment files (`.env*`)
- Debug logs (`*.log`)

### IDEs and Editors
- IDE configurations (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`)
- Editor-specific files (`*.iml`, `.history/`)

### Operating System
- System files (`.DS_Store`)
- Temporary files

### Application-Specific
- Admin app build artifacts
- Docs app build artifacts
- CrewAI environment files
- Backend and testing distributions

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Branches Updated**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/develop
   ```

2. **Clean History**
   - Rebase feature branches before merging
   - Use interactive rebase to clean up commits

3. **Protected Branches**
   - `main` and `develop` are protected
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Enforce status checks

4. **Version Tagging**
   - Use semantic versioning (vX.Y.Z)
   - Tag all production releases
   - Include release notes

## GitHub Features We Use

- Pull Request templates
- Issue templates
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Branch protection rules
- Code owners
- Project boards for task tracking

## Getting Started

New team members should:

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a new feature branch from `develop`
3. Make changes and commit
4. Push to GitHub and create a PR
5. Address review comments
6. Squash and merge when approved

Remember to keep your local repository updated and regularly sync with the remote repository.
